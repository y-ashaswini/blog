        I'm Yashaswini, an infinitely curious individual. My desire to know all
        that there is to know in this beautiful cosmos bleeds through and
        colours everything that I do- my daily dose of adrenaline rush comes
        from figuring things out.

        I've only recently begun
        dabbling in Robotics- working with Robotic simulations using ROS and
        Gazebo for a rover; alongside grappling with physics-based simulations
        in Processing(Java). I've been into Web Development for a good long year
        and a half now, with my latest endeavour being a FullStack freelance
        project for a Bangalore-based startup company. And yet, as always, I
        remain well aware of the fact that I've barely even grazed the surface
        of the whole world of knowledge I'm yet to explore.

        And at last- my long-standing fascination with Artificial Intelligence
        and Cryptography (Blockchain technology) remain, as I plod on in the
        journey of trying to complete atleast one of the tons of projects left
        midway, in the lust of another apparently bigger, brighter idea.
