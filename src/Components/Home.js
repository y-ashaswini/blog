        GREETINGS, FROM MY CORNER OF THE INTERNET!
      </span>
      <span className="text-lg tracking-widest mb-2">
        I'm Yashaswini, an infinitely curious individual. My desire to know all
        that there is to know in this beautiful cosmos bleeds through and
        colours everything that I do- my daily dose of adrenaline rush comes
        from figuring things out. I've worked on projects under Web Development,
        Web Design (UI/UX), ROS, and Java.

        As a Computer Science Engineering student at a fairly popular
        university, I find myself at an amusing intersection of technical
        communities and chapters brimming with intelligent and ambitious
        individuals- each more eager to learn and grow than the other. And
        truly, it is rather flattering that I've ended up here- an environment
        that I've come to adore- one that strikes the perfect balance between
        competitive and abundantly informative. I've only recently begun
        dabbling in Robotics- working with Robotic simulations using ROS and
        Gazebo for a rover; alongside grappling with physics-based simulations
        in Processing(Java). I've been into Web Development for a good long year
        and a half now, with my latest endeavour being a FullStack freelance
        project for a Bangalore-based startup company. And yet, as always, I
        remain well aware of the fact that I've barely even grazed the surface
        of the whole world of knowledge I'm yet to explore.

        And at last- my long-standing fascination with Artificial Intelligence
        and Cryptography (Blockchain technology) remain, as I plod on in the
        journey of trying to complete atleast one of the tons of projects left
        midway, in the lust of another apparently bigger, brighter idea.
